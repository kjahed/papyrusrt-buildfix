The purpose of this project is to create and install a default manifest
file to be used by GCC to make applications by default compatible with
all Windows version up to the latest one.  This is required starting with
Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, because applications without
compatibility manifest are treated as compatible only with the oldest
Windows version still supported by the compatibility layer.  On Windows
8.1 this is Windows Vista, for instance.

The only challenge of this project is to keep up with the GUIDs of
the latest Windows versions as they come along.
